# smokeping-mtr-pagerduty

A connector for SmokePing alerts to PagerDuty, very heavily inspired by and stolen from https://github.com/catalyst/smokeping-mtr-alert and https://github.com/logan2211/smokeping-mtr-alert

It supports the edgetrigger option for automatically resolving the alerts, and so requires an installation of SmokePing with https://github.com/oetiker/SmokePing/issues/122 fixed.
